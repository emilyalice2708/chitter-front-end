A small Twitter clone that allows users to post messages to a public stream, using the API given here: [documentation](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend). This program allows the user to view all peeps, individual peeps, sign up, sign in and post new peeps.

As a user,
So that I can see what people have been saying,
I'd like to see all peeps.
```
```
As a user,
So that I can focus on something my friend said,
I'd like to view an individual peep.
```
```
As a user,
So that I can have my own handle,
I'd like to sign up.
```
```
As a user,
So that I can interact with my friends as me,
I'd like to sign in.

```
As a user,
So that I can say what's been on my mind,
I'd like to post my own peep.
```
```
